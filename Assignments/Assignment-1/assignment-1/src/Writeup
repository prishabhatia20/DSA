The code that I translated is a very simple TicTacToe game where players
enter the row and column they want to mark. This game does not follow the
MVC format, so I chose it because I thought it gave me enough basics to
learn in Kotlin (classes, methods, functions, loops, etc.), but it wasn't
so complicated that it would be extremely difficult to figure out and debug.

The TicTacToeBoard class creates a board (list of lists), and has various methods
to check which player is next, check whether a player has won, mark the board,
and return the value at a certain square.

I encountered two main difficulties when translating this code. The first
difficulty was creating the matrix. In Python, it's as simple as the following:
board = [[" ", " ", " "], [" ", " ", " "], [" ", " ", " "]].
However, in this case I had to create three separate lists, each representing
a row on the board, and then create a final main list that had each sublist.

The next difficulty I encountered was creating an init in the class. It turns
out this was hard because I had a line below the init where I tried re-initializing
certain variables, but the process of figuring out why it was not working was
a bit difficult.

Other than these two issues, translating this code was fine. Again, I feel it was
complicated enough for me to get the gist of Kotlin, but simple enough for me
to not have to struggle unnecessarily. I think that this exercise was a good
way for me to become more familiar with this language.
