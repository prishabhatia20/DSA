For the application of the associative array, I implemented a Markov model. I tested it on Edgar Allen Poe's short
story, "Tell Tale Heart", and I found that it worked! One thing that I found odd was that the order of the key-value
pairs in the associative array is not the order that they appear in the story. I think this is because of how the hash
function is implemented, but I think it's something I would fix in the future because it's not intuitive and it would
be nicer to see the words in the order that they appear. I thought it was cool to see the associative array be used in
a different problem rather than just implementing the data structure. I also think with more time (this one is on me),
I would optimize the way the model parses through the text. It currently iterates through every word, which is fine with
the text I'm using because it's so small. However, with bigger texts, it would take a lot of time to go through every
word, and I'm sure there's a better and more optimal way to go about doing that.
